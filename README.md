## My new productivity app that I will inevitably give up on in two weeks

_prodiJ (triple entendre baby; prodigy from being so productive (yeah right), IntelliJ since coding app in Java/JS, and J for Joe)_

**Features?**

Enhanced copy/paste

- Permanent clipboard that can hold images and text between Windows and Citrix sessions and persist even after shutting down.
  - Allow for advanced cataloging based on what was copied / when it was copied
  - Allow for batch exporting of copied content
- Built in password/auto hot key functionality
  - Users can seamlessly add/manage username and password combinations for daily app use and auto entry
  - Can be used across any application in Windows
- Figure out a way to let users easily create macros to streamline daily workflows (CCL queries, uar calls, email responses, etc)
  - Figure out a way of having a user record a particular workflow and having the app automate the workflow moving forward with little to no user input
  - If copying from a spreadsheet into an app for instance, have a guided initial workflow where the app walks the user through clicking each field in both the source and destination a couple times and is “taught” the steps, the applications, and can complete on its own
  - Allow for this to be set up at regular intervals (similar to Ops Jobs) if needed / trusted
  - It would probably be pretty cool for the app to provide a confidence score on how well it can complete whatever it’s asked to do
- Easy to use time tracking for payroll / HR purposes
  - Can use machine learning to record users actions throughout the day to make this automatic
  - If certain actions are automated, allow the user to specify how much time it would have taken otherwise if a bitch ass human was doing it
  - Use machine learning from earlier to automate entering time in at the end of every week
- Automatic Outlook/Skype integration
  - Machine learning to add new meetings or reminders based on emails or pings from important contacts or groups of users
  - Could also use predefined rules to establish priority
  - Could also just use the app to move the mouse around every 2 mins to always show as active when working remote
  - Allow for encrypted messaging that will still be sent through company Skype, but cannot be read outside of the app (idk why anyone wouldn’t just use discord but this could be a fun project)
  - Possibly screen all emails for super positive responses from clients or other users and copy them to a dedicated folder to speed up / automate the brown nosing review process
  - Might be cool to auto-update Skype status throughout the day based on what you are doing (vs just using busy, away, etc)
